The following simulation algorithms are implemented in this program:
  The method of Gale Shapley;
  The method of Gale Shapley with one priority;
  Algorithm of entering into one wave;
  Algorithm of entering into two wave;
  Algorithm of entering into three wave.
Also carried count stable pairs. All the modeling is done using Excel tables. In these models only 5 universities are considered.
